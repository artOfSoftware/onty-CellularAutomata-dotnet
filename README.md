# README

This is a simple implementation of [Finite Cellular Automata](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_automaton) using C#.

## Algorithms

The algorithms implemented include:

1. Conway's Game of Life
1. North-East-Center Min
1. North-East-Center Max
1. North-East-Center Median
1. Swap 0's and 2's

It also supports specifying a custom transformation using a specialized language.
