This is a simple implementation of Finite Cellular Automata using C#.

The algorithms implemented include:
1. Conway's Game of Life
2. North-East-Center Min
3. North-East-Center Max
4. North-East-Center Median
5. Swap 0's and 2's

It also supports specifying a custom transformation using a specialized language.
